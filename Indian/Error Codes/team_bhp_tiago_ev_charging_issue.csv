BHPian thomahawk recently shared this with other enthusiasts. Went to the service center to get the car serviced (6 months) and fix the recurring charging issue. Since the Tata EV TMSC app did not list the service center I went to last time, I decided to drive in without an appointment. The guy at the service desk reception got my details and asked if I had made an appointment – I said NO. He took out a business card and asked me to call up the number and make an appointment for service. I told him that the Tata app doesn’t let me book service at the center; still glued in on his screen he pointed out the dealer’s toll-free number printed on the card. Fair enough, I asked him if they could have a tech look at the charging issue as a ‘running repair’. He said NO and asked me to get an appointment for a running repair as well. The last few times I brought the car for repairs, I had called the service advisors before driving in, so I guess I didn’t need an appointment then. Since there were other issues with the car (window rattles, metal clanking sound from the rear), I didn’t want to head home without getting a tech look at the car. I called up the customer relationship manager and complained about this. He came out and we had a chat; a service advisor was assigned, and he noted down my complaint about the charging issue. He handed me a copy of the job card and told me they’d give me a call – I said I’d wait since they were just going to do a diagnosis. Also sent him the video recording from the day before, showing the charging issue just after plugging in. Unhappy with the treatment (this was after all an issue they supposedly fixed), I sent a message to the Sales Manager (who boasted about matching Toyota’s service experience – since the group were related); I also tried to reach Tata’s regional service manager. Since the regional manager didn’t seem to pick up the call, I sent an email to the mail thread about the delay in AC part replacements. Since the issue cropped up after the service team replaced the radiator fan, I think they are related. The mail had the dealer’s service managers and Tata’s regional service manager looped in. Next, I called up the dealer’s service general manager and told him about my ordeal. He said he’ll help - once he is back in office. Perhaps I’m acting like a spoiled brat (coming from Maruti and Hyundai) – and decided to keep myself occupied with something else. After waiting for 3 hours, I went back to the service desk since they were just supposed to do a diagnostic. The service advisor said my car is being charged – I told him the car had 94% charge left and you don’t need 3 hours to check for an issue that happens when charging is initiated. A technician (DTE or something) came down and the advisor asked him to explain their diagnostic to me. He said the car was fine and asked me to have an electrician look at my home wiring for earthing issues. Perplexed, I asked him why it happens only when the radiator fan must turn ON (the car starts charging immediately if the fan doesn’t have to turn on). My home wiring was upgraded recently and the electrician (contracted out) from Tata had checked all this. I asked him about the error code they said they cleared, and instructions were given to me when I last came there for the same issue (to not let the charge go below 20%). He said whoever told you probably had a misunderstanding and told me I had to run the car down once a month. Now this started to get on my nerves, and I asked him about when does the car decide to turn the fan ON while charging? It turns on even after the car has been idle for more than 6 hours and ambient temperatures are low (night at around 27 degrees Celsius). He kept telling me about the battery pack having to cool down etc. – but didn’t have a clear answer for reproducing the issue at the service center. The fan had to turn-on, and they just put the car on charge and called it a day. Since I wasn’t backing off – he said he would check the car further if I let them keep the car for a day. Since I was not in the mood to have them waste another day – I told them they could look at this when I bring the car for service. Called up the dealer’s toll free and took an appointment – the next slot was 3 days later. Told them I’ll bring the car back and left. Tata’s regional service manager replied to my email that the dealer would help in fixing it – no surprises there. All sorts of thoughts again started going through my head, ‘ZS EV price cut’, ‘Creta Facelift’; Switched to sports mode and floored the car. Just like that, I cut through the traffic and the thoughts – to reach back home with a smile. Tiago EV is a good car – just wish Tata upped the game a bit. The thoughts have now come back as I’m writing this down – guess it’s time for another drive. Check out BHPian comments for more insights and information.

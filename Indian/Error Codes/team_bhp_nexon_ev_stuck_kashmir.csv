It happened to me only once though but it left me stranded. There should be easy fix, because in the service center he just cleared the error code. Why do we need to get stranded. Quote: Originally Posted by akg7091 The main issue is that the HV error is common and happens if the DC charger doesn't work properly. Car goes into safety mode and has to be reset by TASS. Tata engineers should give the option to end user to reset this error from the vehicle itself atleast once with the warning to not connect to the same dc charger again so that people are not left stranded in the middle of nowhere. Tata should also figure out if it can be reset remotely by the TASS team ? Maybe reset the error automatically once the user successfully charges 25% or more using a slow charger ? This is exactly what I mentioned earlier in the thread, a person should not be stranded because of this. We as EV community shared this feedback with Tata. We have asked to provide a way that the car go into safe mode and not charge but can still move so that a person was try to reach a safer place. Also, this issue is not limited to Tata cars. This happens in MG as well. A person faced it twice, everyone can read his experience on the link Quote: Originally Posted by ALTIMAed Sir, the MG ZSEV supports charging using a 15A AC socket.

The charging time using a 15A AC socket are as follows 0% to 100% 18 to 19 hours 0 to 100% time mentioned by you is in correct. It will take about 22-24 hours for the MG provided EVSE to charge the car. MG EVSE works at 2.2 - 2.3 KW and Tata EVSE works at 2.6 - 2.7 KW. I know people who carry Tata EVSE with their MG because the MG EVSE is slower. ( 3 )

I travel extensively on highways in ev, south, north and east. Secondly, it is actually possible to slow charge Nexon ev max in hotel. Full charge takes about 16 hours, so if you connect around 30 percent in the evening, next day by morning your car is ready. I have done this multiple times, and many times hotels did not charge. Mg takes about 22 hours and not feasible to do slow charge. Thank you for the nice clarification, but just a few doubts, @sumannandy, since I have acquired a Punch.EV a month ago, and dreaming/planning a trip from Hyd to Bangalore, Hyd to Thirupathi and Chennai. 1. What is the cable specifications and *length* you use for slow-charging at hotels. 2. And generally speaking, where would these 16A plug points be commonly located in most hotels, since the cable needs to reach the EV with sufficient slack, and 3. Lastly, do you use a multimeter to check the voltage and the earthing. ( )

Everyone knows that charging infra is really spotty and unreliable in the mountains. Again, it is well known that repeated back to back DC charging sessions can lead to the HV error, you should do a slow charge to 100% every once in a while. There are multiple videos online about people attempting Ladakh circuit in EVs and all of them have struggled big time. I salute your bravery and risk appetite for attempting such a drive, especially with family. But such a thing was bound to happen at some point. RSA can’t be expected to be a get out of jail card when you are out in the middle of nowhere. This one is on you, brother! It’s like, you can’t blame Honda if your City gets stuck or damaged if you take it off roading. I don’t see the point of answers like these on a forum which is meant to help each other. The guy has done 65k in his EV across terrains; he obviously knows this basic stuff you have shared. If you don't have anything helpful to offer, why not let the post go. Be it an EV or ICE vehicle having an issue, obviously as an owner he will reach out to the company and nearest dealer. Thats not called a ‘get out of jail card' it’s the basics of customer service.

I wouldn't be too quick to label this as victim shaming, like you're trying to do to here. Let me explain... Yes, this forum is about helping each other with our shared knowledge and collective wisdom and yes, we absolutely should hold the manufacturer responsible for what the product promised to deliver. But this forum is also about cultivating the right attitudes about vehicle usage, giving personal safety the highest priority. Viewed from that lens, I think what Shreyans_Jain says is entirely reasonable. Consider these facts: - EV is a newer and less mature technology, even in the west, where last winter, they woke up to the fact that EV range gets depleted FAST in sub-zero temps! - Tata Motors is no paragon of quality, reliability or customer service. You may expect the best from them, but common sense should nudge you towards preparing for the worst. - A cross-country road-trip (EV/ICE notwithstanding), and that too without a companion car and while being accompanied by family does need some planning and preparation, which the OP seems to have fallen short on in this instance. - In embarking on such a journey in an EV (a Tata one at that), you're essentially betting on nothing going wrong and on a host of external factors going your way - charger network, charger availability when you need it, Tata RSA being at your beck and call through the length of the country, etc.! - There's a fine line between being optimistic and being foolhardy, and in this instance I think we can reasonably conclude that that line has been crossed. Just my two cents, I could be wrong... Last edited by vijaysrk : 17th July 2024 at 10:42 . ( 6 )

Just my two cents, I could be wrong... Fisrtly this is not ""victim shaming"", lets avoid using these Gen Z terms which dont mean anything and are a lazy labelling to avoid a nuanced discussion. This is an honest an open discussion, which Team BHP is the gold standard of. The person has travelled from Bangalore to Leh and previously done 65,000 kms across India in his EV. Do you think that is all without planning? From his post its clear he had planned out his charging stops along the way, based on infrastructure available enroute. I agree with you that EV tech is new and can have issues, like the one quoted from the winter in the US. I would like you to understand this issue happened in Udhampur which is in the foothills of Jammu in July when the average tempertaure there is about 35-40 degrees. A companion car ? Im sorry which Indian family has a backup car on its road trips. Lets live in the real world please. From his post its clear he only reached out to the RSA when the car broke down, how is that being on beck and call. That is literally the RSA's job. I agree Tata vehicles do have issues but does that mean that a customer that has paid close to 20L for his vehicle, just keeps it at home ? The person in question here has travelled across the country. He will obviously only do that if he has confidence in his vehicle. My point is very simple, a person is stranded on a cross country drive with his family in unfamiliar territory. Instead of reaching out to offer help, lets please stop berating him on how all this is his own fault and he is being ""foolhardy"" When any of us are in trouble we are looking for help not ""gyaan"" which offers no value and doesnt solve anything. I know social media has made everyone feel they are experts and social commentators, but try and plug out and come back the real world. ( 8 )

People who are buying EVs are early adopters and paving the way for building an ecosystem for the late adopters, we should be a bit thankful to them at least. TATA provides a warning in their manual against back to back DC charging and recommends a slow charge (AC charging) at least after 4 successive DC charging. That too doesn't guarantees that there'll be no errors (typical TATA handling of an issue - not acceptable). Those who are giving examples of MG or BYD or tesla, should also consider the price point of these EVs and the challanges in rolling out a mass market EV product which only a very few companies across the globe has cracked successfully. This is a relatively newer product category in a price cautious market. Any prospective buyers should do their research beforehand as you're buying into a new ecosystem and yes, this is buyer's responsibility and I feel that many buyers focus more on the lower running costs than the eccentricities of an EV ecosystem while making their decision. That being said, there's no excuses to the bad RSA service in this case as well as this common error which has haunted many Tata ev owners. I've personally had a good experience with TATA RSA but that was in a major city so can't compare. ( )

Quote: When any of us are in trouble we are looking for help not ""gyaan"" which offers no value and doesnt solve anything. While I agree with your views on helping those that are stranded rather than giving gyaan etc, I think what vijaysrk meant by companion car is another car with people in it, accompanying those in the car in question doing the same trip. Not as a backup car. ( 1 )

Please see another thread for a Mahindra Scorpio-N which has stopped four times on the road in a city. See the response times of the RSA for Mahindra. It is not Tata or Mahindra or any other manufacturer problem, it is in general RSA takes time in this country. Thread link (Mahindra ScorpioN keeps stalling after standing still for 2 months for accident repairs) Excerpt from the post Quote: Talking about RSA service it was fine during the first time but during  second and third time it was terrible they took around 3 hours and for  the third time there wasn’t even any communication for around first 1.5  hours.

Sad that OP had to go thru all of this while being so away from home. Have been dreaming about buying Curvv.ev for so many months and all of this just makes me doubtful. Common Tata. Come out publicly and recall the vehicles. International OEMs keep recalling their vehicles even for a small bug like a power window glitch and this HVC is just not acceptable at all. I read somewhere that even Punch.ev suffered from HVC while being on new Acti.ev ( 1 )

As I remember you do have a Nexon Ev so details regarding this will be great. Ideally any electric vehicle should charged AC charger 3.3 or 7.2 or 11 or 22 KW depending on what it supports for better battery life. More the DC fast charging more is the impact on battery. Some manufacturers like BYD, CATL have aced the tech so their battery packs are much more immune to any type of charging. Tata recommends after 4 DC fast charging sessions to do one AC charging session to 100% . The reason is simple when somebody is doing fast charging session, most likely it will be incomplete session (not going to 100%). LFP battery BMS hates incomplete sessions as it is not able to compute the battery percentage correctly due to very minimal discharge curve. ( 1 )

I reached Leh. In the uphill range is about 1-1.5 kms per 1 percent. But then you get lot of downhill also in this route. Srinagar to Sonmarg 90 kms in approx 31 percent uphill from 1500m to 2700m. Sonmarg to Kargil including Zozilla pass 122 kms in 35 percent. Kargil to Mulbekh 39 kms in 16 percent uphill from 2000m to 3300 m. Mulbekh to Leh 180 kms in 48 percent. This included uphill with two passes. @ vijaysrk Yes, I get your point, with Tata EV we need to be careful. Better safe than sorry. But this contract weld error is very specific to TATA EVs. They should not have released the car with this error, or else should have issued a recall. If this was USA, there probably would have been a class action lawsuit.

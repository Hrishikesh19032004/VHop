Now they have replace some part which I will get details tomorrow. I have been getting this exact warning since day 1 of my vehicle. And it only comes when starting the vehicle for the first time of the day. I’m hoping this problem goes away after yesterday’s update. EDIT: Once this problem comes, I don’t have any other choice but to turn the ignition off and then turn it on. But once I turn the ignition on a second time, this problem always goes away.

They have run multiple tests with data sent to the Korean team, it has been concluded that the battery could be a fire hazard. The entire battery will be replaced  and the car will be delivered after a month. All Kona owners who have received the above alert on their dashboards should immediately consult with your local service center. ( 27 )

All Kona owners who have received the above alert on their dashboards should immediately consult with your local service center. The service center is the one in Pune? At Kondhwa? Asking because my vehicle is also at the service center. Wondering if they may need to change my battery as well. Because unlike in your case, in my case I’m able to drive the vehicle after I turn the ignition off and on after getting that electric system warning. ( 4 )

All Kona owners who have received the above alert on their dashboards should immediately consult with your local service center. 3 cars (that I know of) in Bangalore, including mine are down with this issue and had to be towed to the service centers. Another 3 more in Kerala. No confirmation on whether battery replacements are needed though. Guess they'll run the same tests that you mentioned on the cars here as well. ( 20 )

Just got an update from the workshop that the “Check electric system” error was because of some sensor, not sure exactly where. Resetting the sensor to its default values seemed to have removed the problem. They are reporting that they aren’t seeing that error anymore. They are going to observe it for a few days now (while some body work is being done on my vehicle). Fingers crossed & hoping it is just this issue and nothing major as reported by @sheldon.dz for his vehicle (unfortunately, I might add). ( 5 )

Fingers crossed & hoping it is just this issue and nothing major as reported by @sheldon.dz for his vehicle (unfortunately, I might add). Did you ascertain what sensor did they reset ? Just checking as I have never come across this particular explanation so far, for the ""Check EV system"" warning. Nor does it seems like a plausible explanation to me. As to the monitoring part, how are they doing it ? is the car standstill, plugged in to any kind of readers ? My Kona, is tucked away in their garage, awaiting a battery module replacement, after being detected with a fault code, in-line to the issues that were designed to be detected by this infamous BMS update. Surprising thing for me is that I was expecting some sort of deviation in the voltage levels in the cells, but that doesn`t seem to be the case, at least in my car. So, I'm eager to know what this new angle about sensor error, that is now surfacing. Last edited by pkirwadi : 18th December 2020 at 10:59 .

Not sure how far it's true. Not good if it is true because we need more EVs. Currently we only have 3 decent EVs. https://auto.economictimes.indiatime...ports/79791529 ( 4 )

Like the article says, the Kona is one of EU's biggest sellers, which lead them to invest in a brand new manufacturing line in the Czech Republic. It will continue to sell there and in other markets, just not in Korea, and for good reasons. It is still a great car, with one of the most efficient BMS/powertrains in the EV segment worldwide. Besides, this news article is based on another news report from the Korean media. Let's see what Hyundai has to officially say about this. ( 4 )

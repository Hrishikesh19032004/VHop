The higher the NCAP rating, the more safe the car is. The ratings are determined based on carsh-test dummies or the Front offset crash test. In this test, the car moves at a speed of 64 kmph to ensure a 40% overlap with a deformable barrier. The dummies are pre-installed in the car with sensors. Based on the test, the ratings are categorised into Adult and Child Protection scoring. While adult occupant testing has a maximum of 17 points, in child occupant testing the maximum is 49 points. Based on the child and adult occupant testing, the NCAP gives a maximum 5-star rating to the car. A List of 5 Star Rated Cars in India in 2025 1.

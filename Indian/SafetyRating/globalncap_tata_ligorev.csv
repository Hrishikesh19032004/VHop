The recently launched Tata Tigor EV was assessed in its most basic safety specification, fitted with two airbags as standard. Further improvement could be made to the Tigor rating by equipping the model with standard fitment of Electronic Stability Control (ESC), side impact protection, 3 point belts in all seating positions and ISOFIX connectors. Alejandro Furas, Secretary General of Global NCAP said, “Tata has shown consistent safety improvements throughout its fleet range. The Tigor demonstrates that improvements are also possible with EV models, which can pose a technical challenge because of the electric powertrain system. Tata should be recognised and applauded for this commitment to improving their vehicles in response to Global NCAP’s call to democratise vehicle safety.” David Ward, President of the Towards Zero Foundation said, “It is deeply satisfying to see Tata’s continuing commitment to safety as they innovate with new power train technologies in order to achieve wider environmental and sustainability goals. “Safety and sustainability improvements are possible for all manufacturers operating in the Indian market, and Global NCAP would encourage them to follow Tata’s lead.” TATA TIGOR EV (2 airbags) Adult occupant protection The protection offered to the driver head was good and passenger’s head was adequate. Both front passenger’s neck showed good protection. Driver chest showed adequate protection and passenger chest showed good protection. Driver and passenger knees showed marginal protection as they could impact with dangerous structures behind the dashboard supported by the tranfascia tube. Driver and passenger tibias showed adequate and good protection. The bodyshell was rated as unstable and it was not capable of withstanding further loadings. Footwell area was rated as unstable. The car offers standard Seat Belt Reminder (SBR) for driver and passenger.

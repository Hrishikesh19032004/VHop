Tata also holds the top spot for their Safari/Harrier rating. The Nexon voluntarily test is amongst the final results in the campaign as Bharat NCAP is activated. The Nexon was the first model to achieve a five star #SaferCarsForIndia rating in 2018. In 2023 the new Nexon has been updated with additional safety equipment, including six airbags and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) as standard. The new rating is valid for models produced as from August 8th 2023. Global NCAP’s crash test protocols assess frontal and side impact protection for all models, as well as Electronic Stability Control (ESC). Pedestrian protection and side pole impact protection assessments are required for vehicles scoring the highest star ratings. More information on the protocol requirements can be found on the Global NCAP web site: https://www.globalncap.org/resources The Tata Nexon showed a stable structure and robust restraint systems which offered good protection. The model offered almost full protection for child occupants in the dynamic tests and is fitted with i-size anchorages and a passenger airbag disabling switch, making it very versatile for transporting child occupants. The Nexon meets UN127 and GTR9 requirements for pedestrian protection as standard. The model also complies with Global NCAP’s ESC requirements and offers seatbelt reminders in all seating positions. David Ward, President of the Towards Zero Foundation said, “Achieving high standards of crash test safety has now become a core component of the Tata brand in India. We applaud Tata’s leadership for this strategic commitment and look forward to the next stage in the company’s road safety journey.” Tata Nexon (6 airbags) Read the full crash test report Watch the crash test video Download crash test images Note to Editors The Tata Nexon was tested in compliance with 2022 assessment protocols and as voluntary tests.

                        vehicles, a phased manufacturing roadmap has been developed, taking into account the current
                        state of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country, in which indigenous manufacturing of
                        electric vehicles, their assemblies/sub-assemblies, and parts/sub-parts/inputs of the
                        sub-assemblies will be promoted over time through a graded duty structure. The goal is to
                        significantly boost value addition and capacity building in the country. The following Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP) is notified: S.No. Item Description Current BCD

                                    STANDARDS Specifications Technical specifications for electric vehicle chargers vary across Level 1, Level 2,
                            and Level 3 charging stations across different countries. Table below showcases the mapping
                            of
                            different charger specification in India: S. No Charging Station Voltage (V) Power (kW) Type of Vehicle Type of compatible charger 1 Level 1 (AC) 240 <=3.5 kW 4w ,3w,2w Type 1, Bharat AC-001 2 Level 1 (DC) >=48 <=15 kW 4w,3w,2w Bharat DC-001 3 Level 2 (AC) 380-400 <=22 kW 4w,3w,2w Type 1, Type 2, GB/T ,Bharat AC-001 4 Level 3 (AC) 200-1000 22 to 4.3 kW 4w Type 2 5 Level 3 (DC) 200-1000 Up to 400 kW 4w Type 2, CHAdeMO,CCS1,CCS2 Guidelines The Ministry of Power has issued the revised consolidated guidelines & standards for
                            charging infrastructure for electric vehicles on 14th January 2022. The objective of the
                            promulgation is to enable a faster adoption of electric vehicles in India by ensuring safe,
                            reliable, accessible and affordable EV charging infrastructure and eco-system. Key Highlights of the Guidelines and Standards Owners may charge their electric vehicles at their residences and offices using their existing electricity connections. Exhaustive compliance requirements for public EV charging stations have been clarified. Connection would be provided to public EV charging stations within 7 days in metro cities, 15 days in other municipal areas and 30 days in rural areas. The ceiling of Service Charges to be charged by such charging stations would be fixed by the state governments. The tariff for supply of electricity to public EV charging stations would be a single part tariff and would not exceed the “average cost of supply” till 31st March 2025. Through open access, public EV charging station or chain of EV charging stations may obtain electricity from any power generation company. BEE would develop and maintain a national online database of all the public EV charging stations in consultation with State Nodal Agencies Public EV charging stations would be required to tie up with at least one online Network Service Provider to enable advance remote/online booking of charging slots by EV owners. At least one EV charging station shall be available in a grid of 3 Km X 3 Km. Furthermore, one EV charging station shall be set up at every 25 Km on both sides of highways/roads. A phase wise installation of EV Charging infrastructure for mega cities and big cities has been envisaged under the guidelines.

                    point of price parity, the interest of Indian users in electric vehicles is higher than ever before.
                    Start-ups along various components of the electric vehicle value chain, including manufacturing,
                    retail, battery swapping, and software services, are disrupting the existing structure of the auto
                    industry. While the emerging firms continue to face an uphill challenge in
                    competing with the existing giants of the transportation industry, they are increasingly making
                    their presence felt in the still-undefined consumer market. Furthermore, the integration of emerging
                    technologies, including artificial intelligence, analytics, and machine learning, has put them in a
                    position of technological superiority compared to their petrol or diesel counterparts. Start-ups have identified the merits of electric vehicles and
                    related services. They are ahead in the curve to offer these benefits to the consumers by making the
                    adoption easier for them. They have banked upon the fact that the future is electric as e-mobility
                    will aid the country in reducing the carbon intensity and enable users to opt for a cheaper
                    alternative for fuel. They understand that the shift to electric vehicle is bound to happen as
                    electric vehicles are economical, convenient and environment friendly and therefore, are playing a
                    playing a pivotal role in the evolving electric mobility space in India. At present, there are 399 electric vehicle start-ups in India.

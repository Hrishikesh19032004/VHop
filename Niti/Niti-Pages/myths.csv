                        misconceptions. Some of the common myths are busted here for you: Electric vehicles are uneconomical Fact: Electric vehicles are
                            more economical when you take fuel and maintenance costs. Every new technology follows an economic path where the initial upfront price is higher.
                            This reaches a maximum and then decreases when people adopt this technology commonly.
                            Electric vehicles are the same, but the higher price points are quickly changing as the
                            costs go down. To help with high initial costs, many subsidies and incentives are offered by
                            the government. The contribution to reduced life-cycle costs comes from the lower
                            operation and maintenance costs as electric vehicles have fewer moving parts and less wear
                            and tear. It takes too long to charge Fact: Cars spend over 90%
                            of the time parked. You can plug in your car in this downtime at home to charge it. If you
                            need to charge quickly on the road, fast and rapid chargers are entering the Indian market.
                            Some electric vehicles can charge from 20% - 80% in about half an hour on these chargers. The time of electric vehicle charging depends upon the type of charger used. As per the
                            Bureau of Energy Efficiency, currently available electric vehicles across vehicle segments
                            (2-wheeler, 3-wheeler, 4-wheeler) can be charged from 0%-80% in around 1 – 5 hours from
                            Slow/Moderate chargers while using Fast chargers, electric vehicles can be charged in less
                            than 1 hour. Fast chargers are mainly used to charge electric 4-wheelers with bigger
                            batteries. Electric Vehicle batteries will only last a few years Fact: Electric vehicle
                            batteries last for several years, and many of them will have a life beyond that of the
                            vehicle for storing energy. The fear of the short life span of batteries arises when we start comparing it with the
                            batteries of our smartphones. The batteries used in electric vehicles are superior and
                            designed to offer a long service life. Many manufacturers are providing warranties of 5 to 8
                            years on batteries. The Emission impacts of an electric vehicle are more than a petrol
                        or diesel vehicle Fact: Electric vehicles
                            typically have a smaller carbon footprint than Petrol and Diesel Vehicles, even when
                            accounting for the electricity used for charging and the carbon footprint of manufacturing
                            batteries. Electric vehicles can convert about 59%–62% of the electrical energy from the grid to power
                            at the wheels. Conventional petrol vehicles can only convert almost 17%–21% of the energy
                            stored in petrol to power at the wheels. Even CNG engines are not entirely clean as they
                            emit ammonia and produce particulate emissions. While you might argue that electricity generated for electric vehicles also leads to carbon
                            pollution, the amount varies directly with how the local power is generated. India has
                            ambitions to achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from
                            non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by the year 2030. Studies in Europe have shown that petrol or diesel vehicles emit 3 times more carbon dioxide
                            than an equivalent electric vehicle, even when considering the carbon footprint of charging. Electric vehicles have very low range Fact: The range of electric
                            vehicles is enough for the typical daily mileage of the average Indian driver. It’s natural for drivers to be concerned about being stranded with a flat battery miles from
                            a charging station, but as electric vehicles become more commonplace, their range is
                            increasing. The electric vehicles currently available can easily accommodate the average
                            daily mileage of Indian drivers. As per the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, the average range of electric 2-wheelers currently
                            available in the market is around 84 km per charge, which is enough for day-to-day travel
                            within a city. The average range of electric cars available in the market is between
                            150-200 km per charge. This range, when considered with the continuously increasing charging
                            infrastructure, makes commuting even inter-cities easier. Electric vehicles are slow and have bad performance Fact: Electric vehicles
                            perform better Than petrol or diesel vehicles because they are more efficient and have
                            better acceleration. Electric vehicles are powered by an electric motor that generates torque instantly without
                            any gears. As soon as you push down the accelerator, the electric vehicles will accelerate
                            from stationary without lag. India’s electricity grid is not suited for electric vehicles Fact: Electric vehicles
                            result in a reduction of life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions even with the current Indian
                            grid fuel mix. India has committed to having 175 GW of installed Renewable Energy (RE) capacity by 2022 and
                            up to 450 GW by 2030. The current weighted average emission factor of the country for the
                            national grid has been nearly constant over the past few years at 0.82 tCO2 / MWh (as of
                            2018-19). As the share of renewables increases and dependency on coal decreases, the overall emissions
                            from electric vehicles use will also decrease further. India’s electric vehicle charging stations are not enough Fact: When you need to
                            charge while on the road, you’ll find 934 stations in India available to the public. If you
                            can install a charger at home where you park, you can charge your vehicle conveniently
                            there. There are already 934 charging stations in India with more and more providers, both public
                            and private, entering the space. Measures have been taken by the government to ensure public
                            charging infrastructure penetration further increases. The Ministry of Power (MoP) provides
                            the following minimum requirements for the location of public charging stations: At least one charging station should be available in a grid of 3km x 3km. One charging station to be set up every 25km on both sides of highways/roads The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) amended its Model
                            Building Byelaws (MBBL) 2016 to include the provision of electric vehicle charging in
                            buildings Charging infrastructure shall be provided for electric vehicles at 20% of all ‘vehicle
                                holding capacity’/’parking capacity’ at the premises. The building premises will have to have an additional power load, equivalent to the
                                power required for all charging points to be operated simultaneously, with a safety
                                factor of 1.25. Electric vehicles get damaged in waterlogged areas and are
                        dangerous to charge in the rain Fact: An undamaged
                            electric vehicle will have water ingress protection. This means that its electrical
                            components are well-sealed and extremely unlikely to provide an electrical hazard. All electric vehicles come with compliance to an Ingress Protection (IP) as standard. Most
                            of the electric vehicles have an IP67 rating or more; here 67 represents the protection
                            against two elements - dust and water. To give you reference, anything past 67 is generally
                            used for specialized equipment such as submarines. Thus, your electric vehicle will not have
                            any malfunction and will not conduct electricity in and around water if it has not been
                            previously damaged.

                                vehicles in India was lack of public charging infrastructure. Thus, India needs to have
                                a robust backbone for charging infrastructure across the length and breadth of the
                                country with considerations of traffic and population density. Infrastructure segment
                                includes charging infrastructure, battery swapping stations, and businesses build on
                                traction battery. To further evaluate the business models under this category, Click below Business in infrastructure Energy Research shows that a private vehicle stands idle
                                for an estimated 95% of its lifetime. This very fact builds the premise for energy as a
                                value area. Batteries in electric vehicles store electricity. When not in use for
                                commuting, electric vehicle owners can trade/ sell/ utilize the stored power and earn
                                additional revenues. Energy segment includes electricity used for
                                charging vehicles and storing in electric vehicle batteries. Additionally, electric
                                vehicles can be charged from Renewable Energy sources and actually help in contributing
                                to grid stability by storing wind power in night and solar power in day and in turn help
                                in proliferation of Renewable Energy and contribute to reducing GHG emissions. To understand how energy stored in the electric vehicle
                                batteries can provide value to its owner, and areas where you can evolve your business

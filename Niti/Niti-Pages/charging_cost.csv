                        Tariffs differ from one state to the next. Each state sets its own rates for distinct consumer
                        groups, therefore the two sides of the tariff, energy and demand charges, differ from one
                        another. The National Tariff Policy, on the other hand, remains the overarching
                        guidance for SERCs in determining tariffs, stating that the electric vehicle (EV) commission
                        shall not exceed the
                        Average Cost of Supply (ACoS) by more than 15%. Check out tariff applicable in your state below: Madhya Pradesh Energy Charger: 5.9 to RS. 6/kwh Demand Charge Low Tension: - High Tension: Rs 100 to 120/kVA of billing demand Extempted Demand Charges: The fixed or demand charge for an electricity connection is levied on the sanctioned load for
                        the connection or the maximum power demand registered during the billing period, which must be
                        paid irrespective of the actual power usage. Considering the low demand for charging during the
                        early phase of EV adoption, demand charge exemptions for EV charging connections can improve the
                        business case for setting up charging points. Reduced Energy Charges: Energy charges are the variable component of an electricity tariff, applied on the total volume
                        of energy/electricity consumed during the billing period. Reduced energy charges for EV charging
                        benefit CPOs, which can reduce their operational expenditure, and EV users benefit through lower
                        charging costs.

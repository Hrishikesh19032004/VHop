""- Shri Amitabh KantCEO, NITI Aayog","Electric Vehicles are simpleDriving and maintaining your electric vehicle is a
                                        breeze. With no
                                        gears, spark plugs and fuel tanks, electric vehicles truly redefine convenience.
                                        What's more?
                                        electric vehicles are as simple to charge as your mobile phone. You can plug-in

                                        sipping coffee, at office during work or at home while you sleep.","Electric Vehicles are safeAre thoughts of fire-risks from flammable batteries
                                        doing rounds in your mind? Breathe a sigh of relief. The frequency and severity
                                        of fires from electric vehicles are comparable or slightly lesser than
                                        conventional vehicles.
                                        Only about 0.006% of electric vehicles have caught fire compared to 0.07% of
                                        internal combustion engine vehicles as
                                        per 2018 data of NFPA, U.S. Besides, more scientific research to discover lesser
                                        flammable materials is already underway.","Electric Vehicles can handle your daily travel needsA fully charged pure electric vehicle is all that you
                                        need for your
                                        household's typical daily uses. Why? Unlike conventional vehicles, electric
                                        vehicles can be
                                        recharged on a top-up basis. Moreover, most electric vehicles can go up to 60 to
                                        110 km on a
                                        single charge, which is well beyond the average distance travelled by commuters
                                        per day.","Electric Vehicles are for allDiversity and inclusion are fundamental to electric

                                        supporting the presence, ideas and contribution of a diverse set of people.
                                        Women constitute an increasing proportion of the value chain.","Electric Vehicles are cost-effectiveElectric vehicles are more affordable to buy, own and
                                        operate than
                                        ever before. Electric two-wheelers and electric three-wheelers are already
                                        cost-competitive. Electric four-wheelers are economically
                                        viable for commercial fleet operations. A typical fleet car travels about 190 km
                                        per day, while the breakeven distance for an average electric sedan is just 164
                                        km per day. Besides the already rock-bottom running costs, the upfront costs are
                                        set to decline a lot more with falling battery prices in the future.","Electric Vehicle charging is accessible and convenientYou won't have to wait too long to charge your electric

                                        on its way to become mainstream. What‚Äôs more? As the Indian Power Ministry has
                                        set targets to include atleast one public charging station in every 3km x 3km
                                        grid in the urban areas, electric vehicle charging is assured to be within easy

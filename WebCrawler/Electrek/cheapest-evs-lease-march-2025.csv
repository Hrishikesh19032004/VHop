Right now, a few EVs are going for under $300 a month. Here are the cheapest EVs we could find this March. Cheapest EVs you can lease this March After a record year with over 1.3 million EVs sold in the US in 2024, the trend is expected to continue in 2025, with about 15 new models arriving. Nearly 200,000 electric vehicles were sold in the first two months of the year. In February, the top five best-selling models were the Tesla Model Y, Model 3, Honda Prologue , and Rivian R1S. Outside of Rivian’s electric SUV and now the Tesla Model Y (the old model is sold out), you can lease any of them for under $300 a month this March. With the average monthly lease payment for an electric car $175 less per month than the average loan, it’s no wonder buyers are choosing to lease.

Again, all of these are under $300 a month right now.

The Niro EV is one of the cheapest EVs you can lease this month at just $129 per month. The new 2025 IONIQ 5 (now with more range and a Tesla NACS charging port) and IONIQ 6 are arriving with big discounts. Even the luxury 2025 Genesis GV60 can be leased for under $300 a month this March. Earlier this week, Hyundai launched a promo giving those who buy or lease a new 2024 or 2025 model year IONIQ 5 or IONIQ 6 a free ChargePoint Level 2 home charger. If you already have one, you can also opt for a $400 public charging credit.

In the second half of 2024, the Prologue was the second best-selling electric SUV behind the Tesla Model Y. It has now been a top five best-seller in the US for the first two months of 2025. With an ultra-low lease rate of just $239 per month, the Prologue is even more affordable than a Civic this month. No wonder sales are surging. Honda launched the 2025 model earlier this month, which has more range (now up to 308 miles) and power but keeps the same low starting price. Acura’s luxury electric SUV can be leased for as low as $299 for 24 months. With only $2,999 due at signing, the ZDX is even cheaper than the Genesis GV60, thanks to generous discounts. In some states, ZDX discounts reach as high as $28,000 , also making it more affordable than a Civic to lease this month.

The electric Equinox was among the top five best-selling EVs in the final three months of 2024. Both can be leased for under $300 a month this March. The Blazer EV is still slightly more expensive, at $3,879. Keep in mind that the Blazer EV deal also includes a $1,000 trade-in bonus. The electric Equinox SUV, or “America’s most affordable +315 miles range EV,” as Chevy calls it, is even cheaper than the gas model this month with up to $8,500 in savings.

The Tesla Model 3 is still one the best-selling EVs in the US, and for a good reason. The new Long Range AWD Model 3 has an EPA-estimated driving range of up to 363 miles and can add up to 195 miles in just 15 minutes.

The $239 per month Honda Prologue lease deal is offered in California and other ZEV states. Acura’s $299 ZDX promo is only available in CA, NY, OR, and other select states. In other parts of the country, the Prologue is still listed at just $269 per month for 36 months. With $3,199 due at signing, the effective cost is still just $358 per month. However, a $1,000 conquest or loyalty offer can lower monthly payments to around $330. With the Trump administration looking to end federal EV incentives , including the $7,500 tax credit, many of these savings could disappear soon. Automakers can offer such low lease prices right now largely because the tax credit is factored in. Add Electrek to your Google News feed. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

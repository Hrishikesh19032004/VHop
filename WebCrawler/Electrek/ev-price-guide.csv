a second EV to your household or buy your first EV? You can often get price matches if you take a dealer-advertised
price to nearby competitors. Use the links below to verify a discount is still
advertised prior to discussing with the competitor, and refer to the
actual data on the advertising dealer s website while negotiating. Using our
data, you can get the best electric vehicle price without having to hassle with
the dealer. Updates to our best electric vehicle price list are
performed a few times per month. The entire table is typically updated during
the first two weeks of the month. Minor updates are then performed through the
end of the month to capture any discounts found on new models and from
dealers not currently on the list. Looking for lease deals? See our list of the EV lease
offers from dealers across the US . Shortcuts to Dealers
Listed: Acura – Audi – BMW – Cadillac – Chevrolet – Dodge – FIAT – Ford – Genesis – GMC – Honda – Hyundai – Jaguar – Jeep – Kia – Lexus – Mini – Mercedes – Nissan – Polestar – Subaru – Toyota – Volkswagen – Volvo Latest Update: 3/23/2025 3/23/2025: Updated BMW , Mini and Mercedes-Benz discounts. Prices seen in Autotrader,
Leasehackr, and Cars.com are used for these brands since dealers of these brands
don t seem to advertise discounts on their websites. 3/13/2025: Updated discounts for Acura, Audi, Cadillac,
Chevy, FIAT, Ford, Genesis, GMC, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Lexus, Nissan, Subaru,
and Volvo. Added Dodge and Jeep . Some
observations: – Not many Acura dealers are
advertising ZDX discounts, but there are a number of them offering great ZDX lease
deals . – Discounts on the 2025 Audi Q4 e-tron continue to improve. Q8 e-tron deals are also
improving. Q6 e-tron pricing remains at MSRP, but lease offers on
the new-for-2025 model are much improved . – Cadillac dealers are starting to discount the recently introduced OPTIQ. – Deep dealer discounts on the Chevy Equinox EV, Blazer EV, and 2024 Silverado EV work
trucks are continuing.  Availability of 2025 Silverado EV LT pickups seem
to have waned; many dealerships that stocked them last month no longer have any
on the lot. – Dealer discounts on the Honda Prologue may be pale in comparison to discounts on its
Chevy-built platform siblings, but the Factory lease
terms on remaining 2024 inventory of this popular EV undercut the Factory
lease offers on the Blazer EV and Equinox EV. – Many Jeep dealerships seem to be
having trouble keeping the Wagoneer S in stock, perhaps due to excellent factory
lease terms . Even so, a few dealerships are advertising five-figure
discounts on 2024 models . – Ford F-150
discounts are still running deep, even on the Pro trim. Lease deals on
the XLT and Flash trims are incredible . Discounts and lease deals on the
Mach-E are also attractive. – Dodge dealerships are offering hefty discounts on the just-introduced Charger Daytona
R/T, some taking more than $10K off MSRP. – Dealer discounts on Hyundai and Kia EVs remain substantial.
Same with Nissan dealer discounts on the Ariya and LEAF. – More Volkswagen dealers have started to discount the ID.Buzz, many in the $4K-$5K range. ID.4
inventory seems to building back up, albeit with 2025 models, so the dealer
discounts on the ID.4 are much less than they were last month. – The latest Costco member-only incentives range
from $1000 to $2000 on selected EVs from Audi, Chevrolet, GMC, and Volvo.

    Mt CO2 47% change since 2000 Explore all World data The IEA Energy Data Centre provides the world’s most authoritative and comprehensive source of global energy data The IEA collects, assesses and disseminates energy statistics on supply and demand, compiled into energy balances. In addition, the Energy Data Centre has developed a number of other key energy-related indicators, including energy prices, public RD&D and measures of energy efficiency, with other measures in development. The time series stretches back to 1971, and currently covers up to 95% of global energy supply and over 150 countries. The focus is on quality, comparability, and alignment with internationally agreed definitions and methodologies, and close collaboration with national offices responsible for energy statistics and other relevant stakeholders. This emphasis on sound data provides a unique platform for modelling work and tracking both short-term shifts and long-term trends in countries’ energy transitions, particularly for clean energy. Furthermore, the IEA Energy Data Centre has established close cooperation with national and regional organisations on training and capacity building activities. As well as allowing for expanded coverage, this further ensures the quality of the Centre’s data products.

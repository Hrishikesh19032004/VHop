With input from country officials and a wide range of international experts, the report covers over 50 policy types across more than 60 countries, and, in total, catalogues over 5 000 energy policies, all available on a publicly accessible database — the IEA’s Energy Policy Inventory . The report offers a synthesis of this comprehensive dataset, helping users to make sense of latest trends and compare energy policy positions across different countries. Each year, State of Energy Policy will provide updates, building on the IEA’s comprehensive annual review of policies to inform its Global Energy and Climate modelling. Future editions will continue to expand on the types of policies covered.

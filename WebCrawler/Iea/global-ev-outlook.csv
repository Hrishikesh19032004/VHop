Read documentation cross Reports Global EV Outlook 2024 Global EV Outlook 2024 Moving towards increased affordability Download PDF Overview Previous editions 9 About this report The Global EV Outlook is an annual publication that identifies and assesses recent developments in electric mobility across the globe. It is developed with the support of members of the Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI). Combining analysis of historical data with projections – now extended to 2035 – the report examines key areas of interest such as the deployment of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, battery demand, investment trends, and related policy developments in major and emerging markets. It also considers what wider EV adoption means for electricity and oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The report includes analysis of lessons learned from leading markets, providing information for policy makers and stakeholders on policy frameworks and market systems that support electric vehicle uptake. This edition also features analysis of electric vehicle affordability, second-hand markets, lifecycle emissions of electric cars and their batteries, and grid impacts from charging medium- and heavy-duty electric trucks. Two online tools are made available alongside the report: the Global EV Data Explorer and the Global EV Policy Explorer, which allow users to interactively explore EV statistics and projections, and policy measures worldwide.

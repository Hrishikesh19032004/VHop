The report draws on our team of specialists around the world and looks at scenarios for how these trends will impact the automotive, oil, electricity, infrastructure and battery materials markets, as well as CO2 emissions. The picture today EV sales Electric vehicle markets around the world are not all travelling in the same direction or at the same speed in 2024. Sales of EVs continue to rise globally, but some markets are experiencing a significant slowdown and many automakers have pushed back their EV targets. Progress varies by segment, with electric commercial vehicles set for another blistering year and segments like buses and two- and three-wheelers already reaching very high levels of electrification. % Vans and trucks Size of EV fleet 0% EV share of sales c Passenger cars Size of EV fleet EV share of sales u Buses Size of EV fleet EV share of sales w 2 and 3 wheelers Size of EV fleet EV share of sales All figures 2023 Passenger EV sales China still dominates the global EV market, but sales are rising quickly elsewhere too. Electric vehicles are no longer only a wealthy country phenomenon. Developing economies like Thailand, India, Turkey, Brazil and others are all experiencing record sales as more low-cost electric models are targeted at local buyers Global passenger EV sales by market Chart Bar chart with 11 data series.

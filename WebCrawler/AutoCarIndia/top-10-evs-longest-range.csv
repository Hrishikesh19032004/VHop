Published On Feb 03, 2025 04:21:00 PM 1,27,035 Views Follow us on By Saptarshi Mondal Share - It’s safe to say that the EV scene in India is no longer in its nascency. Consumer interest in EVs has been increasing thanks to steady growth in charging infrastructure, more affordable and accessible pricing, zero emissions and expanding choice across all price ranges. However, range anxiety continues to stand in the way of many buyers looking to purchase an EV. While the concerns are valid, many car manufacturers these days offer EVs that provide sufficient range on a single charge, enough even for highway runs. We’ve compiled a list of 10 electric cars and SUVs that boast the longest claimed range on a single charge (as of February 2025). Do note that this list has been ranked based on cars tested on the stringent WLTP cycle, and not the more relaxed ARAI testing cycle. So naturally, the list focuses on the premium end of the EV range in India. 10. Mahindra XEV 9e - 533km Price: Rs 21.9 lakh-30.5 lakh Starting off the list is the Mahindra XEV 9e , which hit the Indian market in November 2024. Two variants of the XEV 9e are on offer at the moment: Pack One and Pack Three. The entry-level Pack One variant features a 59kWh battery pack that can last for up to an ARAI-certified 542km on a single charge. The larger 79kWh battery in the Pack Three trim, meanwhile, offers a WLTP-certified range of 533km. Among the lofty global brands in this list, it’s encouraging to see some Indian representation. 9. Mahindra BE 6 - 550km Price: Rs 18.9 lakh-26.9 lakh The Mahindra BE 6 was launched alongside the XEV 9e to herald the carmaker’s electric-only BE sub-brand, and it wouldn’t be much of a stretch to call it one of most striking SUVs on sale today. Much like the XEV 9e, the BE 6 comes standard with a 59kWh battery pack but offers a better ARAI-certified range of up to 556km. BE 6 buyers can also opt for a 79kWh battery that promises a WLTP-certified range of 550km in Pack Three guise, 17km more than the XEV 9e. Rather impressively, the BE 6 is also the most affordable EV on this list. 8. Kia EV9 - 561km Price: Rs 1.3 crore Kia brought the EV9 to India last year to position the electric SUV as the carmaker’s flagship offering. As a CBU, the EV9 is only available in one state of tune, featuring a huge 99.8kWh battery pack and dual motors with a WLTP-certified range of 561km. Considering the EV9 is the largest EV on this list and can even sprint from 0-100kph in 5.3 seconds, the claimed range is quite remarkable. 7. BYD Seal - 570 km Price: Rs 41 lakh-53 lakh The Seal is the third BYD car for India and is available with multiple powertrain and battery pack options. The entry-level, single-motor, rear-wheel-drive EV Dynamic variant gets a 61.44kWh battery pack, while the larger 82.56kWh battery pack is available in the higher EV Premium and EV Performance variants. The bigger battery pack and RWD configuration has a WLTP-certified range of 570km, and we had a chance to review this electric sedan on Indian roads. Click here to read our review. 6. Mercedes-AMG EQS 53 4Matic+ - 586km Price: Rs 2.45 crore The Mercedes-AMG EQS is one of the carmaker’s most premium EVs on sale in India . The powerful electric sedan gets a dual motor setup that puts out 761hp in Race Start mode, and with boost function activated, the maximum torque produced stands at 1020Nm. Mercedes-AMG claims that the EQS 53 can dispatch the 0-100kph run in 3.4 seconds and has a top speed of 250kph. The Mercedes-AMG EQS 53 4Matic+ gets a 107.8kWh battery that supports DC fast charging up to 200kW and has a WLTP-certified range of 586km. 5. Porsche Macan Turbo - 591km Price: Rs 1.65 crore At the beginning of 2024, Porsche unveiled an electric version of the Macan SUV . It’s built on the brand’s new PPE (Premium Platform Electric) platform, which is also shared with the Audi Q6 e-tron and the upcoming Porsche Cayenne EV. The Macan Turbo is powered by two electric motors that produce a total of 639hp and up to 1,130Nm for short periods of overboost. This enables the electric SUV to go from 0-100kph in 3.3sec and reach a top speed of 260kph. The electric Macan uses a 95kWh battery that can be charged at speeds of up to 270kW. 4. Lotus Eletre / Audi Q8 e-tron sportback - 600km Lotus Eletre price - Rs 2.55 crore-2.99 crore Audi Q8 e-tron price - Rs 1.14 crore-1.30 crore Tied in third position are 2 luxury SUVs from Lotus and Audi . The Lotus Eletre and Eletre S get a 603hp dual-motor system that allows them to sprint from 0-100kph in 4.5 seconds. They’re available with a 112kWh battery, giving them a claimed range of 600km as per the WLTP cycle. The Audi Q8 e-tron was launched in India last year, and while it's available in 2 variants and 2 body styles, it's the Q8 e-tron Sportback 55 variant that has the highest range of the lot with a WLTP certified range of 600km. The electric SUV gets a 114kWh battery and two electric motors that produce 340hp and 408hp in the 50 and 55 variants, respectively. 3. BMW i7 - 603km Price: Rs 1.95 crore The BMW i7 is an all-electric derivative of the 7 Series , and visually differentiates itself with subtle blue accents on the body and an “i” badge on the front grille. For Indian buyers, the i7 is available in two variants: eDrive50 M Sport and xDrive M70. Both get dual motors and a 101.7 kWh battery pack, with the eDrive50 offering 449hp, 650Nm of torque, and a 603km WLTP-certified range. The range-topping i7 M70 ups the output to 650hp and 1015Nm, but takes a hit on the range front with 488km-560km on the WLTP cycle. 2. Lotus Emeya - 610km Price: Rs 2.34 crore (prices for higher variants TBA) Launched in India just two weeks ago, the Lotus Emeya is the newest EV on this list and comes in three variants. The standard Emeya, priced at Rs 2.34 crore, gets a dual motor, 102kWh battery setup that offers 600hp and 710Nm, and a WLTP-certified range of up to 610km. The mid-spec S gets the same internals, but with a lower 540km WLTP range. The top-spec Emeya R, meanwhile, is the sportiest variant of the lot thanks to its whopping 905hp and 985Nm output, but it has the lowest WLTP range at up to 435km. 1. Mercedes-Benz EQS - 677km Price: Rs 1.55 crore-2.45 crore The Mercedes EQS 580 is the sporty electric four-door ‘coupe’ alter ego of the luxurious S-Class, and tops our list with a WLTP-certified range of up to 677km. It's powered by a 107.8kWh battery, dual motor setup that produces 523hp and 855Nm, and local assembly in Mercedes’ Pune facility has ensured that the EQS 580’s pricing doesn’t reach stratospheric levels. The EQS 580 even helped us set a new Guinness World Record for the longest journey by an EV on a single charge. All prices ex-showroom, India.

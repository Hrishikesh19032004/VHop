With over a 70 percent share of the EV market last year, the Indian automaker virtually dominated the electric segment. And Tata plans on making sure this continues with the Punch EV in the coming year too. Thanks largely to its micro SUV appeal, the Punch was already a hit, and with the EV powertrain, it’s now the most affordable electric SUV on the market priced between Rs 10.99 lakh-15.49 lakh. So with no direct competition, it’s on the right path to becoming India’s bestselling EV adding to its maker’s massive market share. Available with two battery-motor options, with claimed range figures of 315-421km on a single charge, the EV’s specs are impressive, so we put it through our instrumental road test to find out how it really performs.

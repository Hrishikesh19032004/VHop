Published On Jan 31, 2025 03:36:00 PM 14,293 Views Follow us on By Saptarshi Mondal Share - The last few months have seen a swarm of new midsize electric SUVs make their way into the market. Mahindra kicked things off late last year with the launch of the BE 6 and XEV 9e, followed by Hyundai and Maruti Suzuki with the Creta Electric and e Vitara, respectively, at the Auto Expo . These midsize electric SUVs come with much larger batteries than the compact electric SUVs and hatchbacks that characterised the Indian mass-market EV space so far, and naturally, positively addressed the biggest concern for electric vehicle buyers – range. We compile a list of all midsize electric SUVs currently available in the market, and rank them in ascending order as per their claimed range. Read on to find out which electric SUV can go the farthest on a single charge. MG ZS EV MG ZS EV fact file Battery 50.3kWh Range 461km Price Rs 19.98 lakh – Rs 24.23 lakh The ZS EV is the electric equivalent of the MG Astor , and has been adapted from an ICE platform. It is the oldest of the midsize electric SUVs currently on sale, but it’s battery size of about 50kWh is par for the course in this segment. A claimed range of 461km is decent, but unlike others here, the ZS EV only gets a single battery option. The battery powers a front axle-mounted electric motor that produces 177hp and 280Nm.

It gets two battery option, 42kWh and 51.4kWh, but the smaller one's claimed range of 390km is the lowest in this category. It does allow for a competitive entry-level price, though. The larger battery's range improves to a respectable 473km. Power figures are 135hp and 171hp for the 42kWh and 51.4kWh batteries, respectively; torque is 255Nm for both. The Creta Electric is an adaptation of its ICE sibling and the exterior and interior design is quiet similar. Tata Curvv EV Tata Curvv EV fact file Battery 45kWh/55kWh Range 430km/502km Price Rs 17.49 lakh – Rs 21.99 lakh The Curvv EV sets itself apart with a coupe-SUV body style, and is the most affordable midsize electric SUV here. It is based on the Nexon platform that has been heavily modified for an electric powertrain. Its batteries are slightly larger than the Creta Electric, which results in a greater claimed range. On the performance front, the 45kWh variant produces 150hp and 215Nm, while the 55kWh variant produces 167hp and 215Nm. The Curvv also has petrol and diesel powertrain options.

It's assembled here using CKD kits, which is why it is also the most expensive electric SUV here. A tad larger than other SUVs on this list at 4.45 metres, the Atto 3 doesn't have ICE equivalents as it's a born EV. This helps with interior packaging and allows for larger battery packs with greater range. Both battery packs use a front axle-mounted electric motor producing 204hp and 310Nm. Mahindra XEV 9e Mahindra XEV 9e fact file Battery 59kWh/79kWh Range 542km/656km Price Rs 21.90 lakh – Rs 30.90 lakh The XEV 9e is also a born-electric SUV, which, incidentally, uses BYD’s proprietary Blade cell technology in its battery pack. It has the largest batteries amongst all the midsize electric SUVs, and apart its sibling, the BE 6, is the only other rear wheel-driven model. Naturally, its claimed range is in a different league altogether, and so is its performance. The rear axle motor produces 231hp with the 59kWh battery and 286hp with the 79kWh unit; torque is 380Nm for both. The XEV 9e is on the more expensive side, but it also offers greater value with greater range. Mahindra BE 6 Mahindra BE 6 fact file Battery 59kWh/79kWh Range 556km/682km Price Rs 18.90 lakh – Rs 26.90 lakh The BE 6 is identical to the XEV 9e under its skin, so it carries over the same rear-wheel-drive layout and battery pack options, arguably in a more stylish package. It is also slightly smaller and lighter than the XEV 9e, which is what gives it the edge in terms of range. With 682km on a single charge with the larger 79kWh battery pack, it has the highest claimed range among all mainstream electric SUVs in India. If you had to choose an EV for inter-city trips, the BE 6 is the only option, for now. Do note that we haven’t considered the Maruti Suzuki e Vitara here because the carmaker hasn’t yet revealed an ARAI range figure. Maruti says it will do over 500km on a single charge, but that’s as per their own internal testing. We will have an exact figure closer to its launch in March, so stay tuned for an update.
